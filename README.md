# LeetCode Java Solutions
Welcome to my repository of Java solutions for various LeetCode problems. This collection represents my journey in improving problem-solving skills, understanding algorithms, and preparing for coding interviews.

# Overview
Language: Java
Platform: LeetCode
Author: Pratiksha Dandriyal
Purpose: To track my progress, share my solutions, and help others who are also preparing for coding interviews.
Repository Structure
The solutions are categorized based on the type of problem, such as arrays, strings, dynamic programming, and more. Each file contains the problem's solution, with explanations and comments for better understanding.

# Contribution Guidelines

If you have suggestions for improvements or want to add new solutions:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (git checkout -b new-feature-branch).
3. Make your changes or additions.
4. Commit and push to your branch (git push origin new-feature-branch).
5. Create a pull request.
   
#Problem-Solving Approach
In each solution, I aim to:
1. Implement clear and efficient algorithms.
2. Use appropriate data structures.
3. Write clean and well-commented code.


#Future Plans
I plan to continuously update this repository with new solutions as I solve more LeetCode problems. Any feedback or suggestions for new problems to solve are always welcome!
